              <p>Go for the bacon plate or the butter burger. Or, better yet, the off-menu Top Ramen with chicken, nori and egg. It’s only available after midnight. Which makes an impossible amount of sense.</p>

              <p>This isn’t a cocktail bar...It’s just, well... a bar. Weird, we know. Yet so very glorious. Here’s Ho’s Bootleg Tavern, a new neighborhood watering hole that harks back to simpler times with a 47-strong whiskey list... You’re here for a night of focused imbibing. For Moscow Mules, Old Fashioneds and other such drinks that are definitely not made by people who call themselves mixologists.</p>

              <p>Ho’s Bootleg Tavern is the creation of Masaye Waugh and Jerrid Wood. This is the first restaurant/bar venture for the pair, but both Waugh and Wood are local industry vets who met while working at Tonic in Russian Hill. Most recently, Waugh could be found at Skylark in the Mission and Wood at Bullitt on Polk Street.</p>

              <p>Ho’s Bootleg Tavern has just decided to let you eat brunch there. Brunch that involves things like bottomless mimosas and Bloody Marias, stuffed french toast and bacon-egg-and-cheese-stuffed potato skins. Because they care.</p>
